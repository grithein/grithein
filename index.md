I am a psychologist and neuroscientist and study the “social brain” as well as core neural mechanisms of information processing. Most of my research combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with paradigms and methods from different disciplines such as social and experimental psychology and behavioural economics. In my research I investigate the neural processing of social motives (e.g., empathy, reciprocity, egoism, collectivism etc), how social motives are affected by learning and psychopathology, and how social motives can be used to alter socially relevant behaviors (motive-based interventions).

Currently, I am establishing the "Neurobiology of Social Behavior" research group.   
We are hosted by the Institute of Medical Psychology at the Goethe-University Frankfurt/M., and funded by the German Research Foundation.
