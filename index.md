I am a psychologist and neuroscientist and principle investigator of the "Biological foundations of Social Behavior" group. We are hosted by the Institute of Medical Psychology at the Goethe-University of Frankfurt/ M. and funded by the German Research foundation (DFG).  

We study the “social brain” as well as core neural mechanisms of information processing. Most of our research combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with paradigms and methods from different disciplines such as social and experimental psychology and behavioural economics. Current topics of interest include sources of prosocial behaviour (emotion-based motives, norm-based motives etc), intergroup processes, and the neural integration of both social and non-social information.
