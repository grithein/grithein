I am a psychologist and neuroscientist who studies the “social brain” as well as core neural mechanisms of information processing. Most of my research combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with paradigms and methods from different disciplines such as social and experimental psychology and behavioural economics. Current topics of interest include sources of prosocial behaviour (emotion-based motives, norm-based motives etc), intergroup processes, and the neural integration of both social and non-social information.
