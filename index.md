I am a psychologist and neuroscientist and head of the Translational Social Neuroscience Unit at the University of Würzburg (Germany). The work of my research group is devoted to the understanding of the motivational sources of behavior. Currently, we study motives that drive social behaviors, for example empathy, reciprocity, collectivism and egoism. We investigate how these motives interact, how they are shaped by learning, and how they are altered across the life span and in psychopathological conditions. Our approach integrates neuroscience, social and experimental psychology, and behavioral economics. We use a range of methods including brain imaging, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments.

We work in close cooperation with the Institute of Medical Psychology at the Goethe-University Frankfurt/M. Our work is funded by the German Research Foundation.
