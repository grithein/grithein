I did my undergraduate studies and Masters in Psychology at the Humboldt-University of Berlin and the City College of New York and conducted my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Max-Planck-Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig. As a postdoc I was based in Cambridge, Frankfurt/Main and the University of California, Berkeley. I worked as senior researcher at the Department of Economics of the University of Zurich, as senior lecturer at the Department of Social Psychology and Social Neuroscience at the University of Bern, and as a Heisenberg-Fellow at the Institute of Medical Psychology at the Goethe-University of Frankfurt/ M. In 2017 I joined the University of WÃ¼rzburg as a Heisenbergprofessor for Translational Social Neuroscience at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychosomatic.

I am married and we have two sons.
