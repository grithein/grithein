I did my undergraduate studies and Masters in Psychology at the Humboldt-University of Berlin and the City College of New York and conducted my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Max-Planck-Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience in Leipzig. As a postdoc, I was based in Cambridge, Frankfurt/Main and the University of California, Berkeley, supported by the Excellence program of the German Research Foundation (DFG; “Emmy Noether” Program). After receiving my habilitation (academic teaching certificate) in Psychology, I worked as a senior lecturer at the Department of Social Psychology and Social Neuroscience, University of Bern. Recently, I was awarded the Heisenberg-Fellowship and research grant by the German Research Foundation to establish my own research group in Germany.

I am married and we have two sons.
