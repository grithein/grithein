# Current research goal

**We aim to understand the motives that drive social behaviors.**

Motives are the driving forces behind human behaviors. If we understand a personâ€™s motives, we understand why this person behaves in a certain way, and how this person will behave in the future. Thus, revealing motives, and the factors that shape them is essential for developing efficient and long-lasting societal and political interventions.

The problem is that motives are well-hidden. They are not observable in behaviour, and often we are not aware of the motives that drive our behaviour, or are unwilling to reveal them. In our previous work we have shown that different social motives can be uncovered based on patterns of brain connectivity, even if they lead to the identical behavior. Moreover, we found that social motives are efficiently altered by learning.

In current research projects these approaches are extended to more complex motivational scenarios with higher ecological validity in which several motives are activated at the same time. We investigate how multiple motives are integrated, and aim to specify the motive or combinations of motives that are most likely to enhance or inhibit relevant social behaviors.
