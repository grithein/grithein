**We aim to understand the motives that drive social behaviors.**

Motives are the driving forces behind human behaviors. If we understand a personâ€™s motives, we understand why this person behaves in a certain way, and how this person will behave in the future. Thus, revealing motives, and the factors that shape them is essential for developing efficient and long-lasting societal and political interventions.

The problem is that motives are well-hidden. They are not observable in behaviour, and often we are not aware of the motives that drive our behaviour, or are unwilling to reveal them. The Neurobiology of Social Behavior Group is devoted to the understanding of the motivational sources of behaviour. Our approach integrates neuroscience, social and experimental psychology, and behavioral economics. We use a range of methods including brain imaging, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments. One goal is to establish the neurophysiological fingerprints of different motivational states, which are then used to reveal the motives behind behaviours, and to investigate the factors that enhance or inhibit these motives.

Our current work focuses on motive that drive social behaviors, for example empathy, reciprocity, collectivism and egoism. We investigate how these motives interact, how they are shaped by learning, and how they are altered across the life span and in psychopathological conditions.
