## Research focus

**Understanding the motives that drive social behaviors

Motives are the driving forces behind human behaviors. If we understand a person’s motives, we understand why this person behaves in a certain way, and how this person will behave in the future. Thus, revealing motives, and the factors that shape them is essential for developing efficient and long-lasting societal and political interventions.
The problem is that motives are well hidden. They are not observable in behavior, and often we are not aware of the motives that drive our behavior, or unwilling to reveal them. The Neurobiology of Social Behavior group is devoted to the understanding of the motivational sources of behavior. We use an interdisciplinary approach that combines neuroscience methods with approaches from social and experimental psychology, and paradigms from economics. Based on this approach, we establish the neurophysiological fingerprints of different motivational states, which are then used to reveal the motives behind a behavior, and to investigate the factors that enhance or inhibit these motives. 
Our current work focuses on motive that drive social behaviors, for example empathy, reciprocity, collectivism and egoism. We investigate how these motives interact, how they are shaped by learning, and how they are altered across the life span and in psychopathological conditions.
